# Pok√©mon Search Experience with Algolia

## üëâ Objective
Develop a responsive web application that enables users to search for Pok√©mon using Algolia. This involves integrating with the Pok√©API to enrich the Pok√©mon data and implementing dynamic search features with filters, including a language switcher to display Pok√©mon names in multiple languages.

## üìù Requirements
- Proficiency in frontend web development (HTML, CSS/Tailwind, JavaScript).
- Basic knowledge of Algolia and its InstantSearch library.
- Use external APIs (Pok√©API).
- Creativity in UI/UX design.

## ü´£ Assignment Details

### Part 1: Dataset Preparation and Enrichment
1. **Initial Setup with Algolia**:
   - Sign up to Algolia and create a new application. (Put the Dashboard URL here)

2. **Download the Provided Pok√©mon Dataset**:
   - Begin with the basic dataset provided. (link the dataset here)
   - Upload the data to your Algolia Application, creating your first index.

4. **Enrich the Dataset Using [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)**:
   - The provided dataset is missing crucial information like `images` and `game_versions`. Enrich the your Algolia Index using the Pok√©API.
   - For each Pok√©mon, retrieve:
     - The image URL, storing it in an `imageUrl` field.
     - The list of game versions it appears in, transforming this into a `game_versions` array.
   - Use Algolia‚Äôs `browseObjects` method to fetch existing records, enrich them with Pok√©API information, and update your dataset using `partialUpdateObjects` to include `game_versions` and `imageUrl`.
   - You can use the Algolia API Docs to conduct your data transformation (provide url to api ref docs here).

#### Expected Format of a Final Record in your newly Algolia Dashboard

```json
{
  "id": 15,
  "name": {
    "english": "Beedrill",
    "japanese": "„Çπ„Éî„Ç¢„Éº",
    "chinese": "Â§ßÈíàËúÇ",
    "french": "Dardargnan"
  },
  "type": ["Bug", "Poison"],
  "base": {
    "HP": 65,
    "Attack": 90,
    "Defense": 40,
    "Sp. Attack": 45,
    "Sp. Defense": 80,
    "Speed": 75
  },
  "game_versions": ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow", "Gold", "Silver", "Crystal"],
  "imageUrl": "https://example.com/beedrill-image.png"
}
```

### Part 2: Building the Search Experience
1. **Project Setup**: Choose your preferred web development framework and set up the project. Use Tailwind or standard CSS/SASS for styling.

2. **Algolia Integration**:
  - Implement Algolia search in your application using the InstantSearch library. (Link to InstantSearch Docs here)

3. **Search Interface**:
  - **Search Bar**: Create a search bar to initiate searches.
  - **Search Results**: Display dynamic search results, showing each Pok√©mon's image, name, type, and stats.
  - **Filters**:
    - Implement filters using instant search custom widget for Pok√©mon type, game versions, and at least one stat (using a range slider). (link to custom widgets here)
    - Ensure the UI for these filters is intuitive and user-friendly.

#### Bonus Challenges
- **Language Switcher**: Implement a dropdown to switch the display language of Pok√©mon names. Support English, Japanese, Chinese, and French.
- **Team Formation**: Allow users to select up to six Pok√©mon to form a team, displaying the team on the page or as a modal with the ability to edit the team's pokemons.
- **Persistent Preferences**: Ensure that your user's language and team preferences are saved and persist a page reload.

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality**: All features including: search, filters, and the bonus features work correctly.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean, well-documented and follow best practices. Important: The exercise should follow a coherent and logical folder structure.
- **User Experience**: The application is intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing across devices.
- **Algolia Integration**: Demonstrates an effective use of Algolia's search capabilities.
- **Creativity and Problem-Solving**: Showcases innovative solutions and thoughtful UI/UX design.

## üéâ Submission Instructions
- Submit your project as a GitHub repository link. Ensure it is public or shared with the relevant parties.
- Include a README file with setup instructions, a brief overview of technologies used, and special instructions for accessing the features you've implemented, especially the bonus challenges.

This assignment is designed to assess your technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities in a practical scenario. We look forward to seeing how you leverage Algolia and the Pok√©API to create an engaging Pok√©mon search experience.

Happy Coding ü™Ñ
